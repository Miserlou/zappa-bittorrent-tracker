# zappa-bittorrent-tracker [![Slack](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-slack-ff69b4.svg)](https://slack.zappa.io/)

An experimental server-less BitTorrent tracker with no webserver and no databse.

Powered entirely by Zappa (API Gateway + AWS Lambda + Flask), with Amazon DynamoDB (or possibly S3) as a database.

Let's see what happens.
